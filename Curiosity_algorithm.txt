what is curiosity and how to "realize" into algorithms.
Here's my some examples.



==== High level curiousity ====

while(1):
  if there is anything :
    try : asking(anything, from_teachers)
    except : memory.save(unsolved_question)
    find_answer(anything, from_any_source)
   
  curiousity = choose(random_subject)
  if curiousity is solved : pass
  elif curiousity <= little_solved :
    f_answer = find_answer(curiousity, from_any_source, passion=Middle)
  # should use fuzzy logic here.
  elif curiousity == initial :
    f_answer = find_answer(curiousity, from_any_source, passion=Full)
   
  if f_answer <= ex_f_answer:
   memory.update(f_answer)
  else : pass #not save or update
  
  
  unsolved_question = picking([f for f in f_answers if f != fullfill])
  reminding(unsolved_question, mood)
  
  
  
  


==== CONSTANTs ====
anything        = dectect(facts)
random_subject  = combination(selected_topics)

topics          = {daily_life : [family, friend, ....], work : [], study, ...}
topics_weight   = [(daily_life, 10), (work, 8), (study, 6), () ...]
selected_topics = selecting_topics(topics, topics_weight, mood)

mood            = affected_mood(situation)
situation       = affted_situation(facts)
facts           = extract_info(vision, melody, temperature, humid, current_time, ...)
